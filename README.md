Play the piano along relaxing rain sounds and cello drones. Check de Demo here: https://js-piano.netlify.com/

This is my first project from the Javascript30 challenge by Wes Boss.

Instead of a drum kit I built a piano and added optional rain sounds and cello drones to play along and improvise.

The piano keys were made with Ableton. 

Hope it helps you relax!
